# HTML Structure Project

This project is the first step in a series where you will build a full webpage from a designer file using semantic HTML. The focus of this task is solely on structuring content using pure HTML—no CSS, JavaScript, or visual styling is required.

## Project Objective

- Recreate the structure of a web page using semantic HTML.
- Follow the layout and content details provided in the Figma design.
- Ensure accessibility and readability using best HTML5 practices.

## Deliverables

- A clean and semantic `index.html` file representing the webpage’s structure.

## Figma Design File

. Create a free Figma account at [figma.com](https://www.figma.com).
. Use the link provided to open the project design.
. Click **"Duplicate to your Drafts"** to have your own editable copy.
. Use this as your reference for page content and structure.

> **Note:** Some fonts may not load if they're missing from your system. You can install them from the following links:

- [Source Sans Pro – Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
- [Spin Cycle OT – Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com)

> **Tip:** Some dimensions in the design are floats—round them off appropriately when needed.

## Structure Guidelines

- Use semantic HTML5 tags: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Ensure accessibility:
  - Use `alt` attributes for images.
  - Organize content using heading levels correctly (`<h1>` to `<h6>`).
  - Use structural and descriptive tags appropriately.
- Keep your HTML readable with indentation and comments.
- Avoid any CSS, JS, or inline styles
